# Trackfolio

**Trackfolio** is a modular, backend-focused portfolio tracker built with Django and Django REST Framework.  
It supports user authentication, asset management, and holding tracking through a clean RESTful API design.

## üîê Authentication

Trackfolio uses **JWT-based authentication** via `SimpleJWT` to securely manage user access:

### Auth Endpoints:
| Method | Endpoint              | Description                    |
|--------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/auth/register/` | Register a new user            |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login/`    | Obtain access and refresh token |
| POST   | `/api/auth/logout/`   | Invalidate user session (token blacklist) |
| POST   | `/api/auth/token/refresh/` | Refresh JWT token           |

- JWT access tokens are used for all protected endpoints.
- Authentication headers must include: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
